# Next Shop dashboard ðŸ›’
This project is part of a courses series where we build an online shop with Stack PERNN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js and Next.js).

[In the first level of this project](https://github.com/Elchicogamer117/YardSaleShop), we made the layout of e-shop.

[In the second level]( https://github.com/Elchicogamer117/ReactShop) we transform that code in components and add important interactions.

[In the third level]( https://github.com/Elchicogamer117/NextShop) we migrate this code to Next to take advantage of this framework.

Now we created a dashboard to modify the products that are presented in the store

You can access the page with the link in the description or [by clicking here]( https://dashboard117.vercel.app/)

Among the main functionalities achieved to this point are:
-	Login system validating it with the project api
-	Graphs to visualize the stock of each type of product
-	Full integration with the api to add, edit and delete products
-	Validation of forms to improve the operation of the app
-	Using Tailwind CSS to ease UI Development
